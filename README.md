# Differentiable-Ranks-and-Sorting-using-Optimal-Transport
Sorting is a necessary tool for machine learning, to create algorithms (k-NN) or test-time metrics like top-k classification accuracy or losses based on the rank. Nevertheless it seems to be a difficult task for automatically differentiable pipelines in DL. Sorting gives us two vectors, this application is not differentiable as we are working with integer-valued permutation. In the paper they aim to implement a differentiable proxy of the basic approach.   The article conceive this proxy by thinking of an optimal assignment problem.  We sort n values by matching them to a probability measure supported on any increasing family of n target values.  Therefore we are considering Optimal Transport (OT) as a relaxation of the basic problem allowing us to extend rank and sort operators using probability measures. The auxiliary measure will be supported on m increasing values with m $\ne$ n.  Introducing regularization with an entropic penalty and applying Sinkhorn iterations will allow to gain back differentiable operators. The smooth approximation of rank and sort allow to use the 0/1 loss and the quantile regression loss.
